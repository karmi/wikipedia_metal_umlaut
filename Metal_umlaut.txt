The '''heavy metal umlaut''', or "'''rock dots'''", is an [[umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]] over letters in the name of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, such as [[Mötley Crüe]] or [[Motörhead]]. The use of Umlauten and other [[diacritic]]s with a [[blackletter]] style [[typeface]] is a form of [[foreign branding]] intended to give a band's logo a [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] quality. It is a form of marketing that evokes stereotypes of boldness and strength commonly attributed to peoples such as the [[Vikings]]; author Reebee Garofalo has attributed its use to a desire for a "[[Gothic horror]]" feel.<ref>Garofalo, pg. 292 <small>''Some groups, for example Blue Öyster Cult and Motörhead, added gratuitous umlauts to their names to conjure up a more generic gothic horror, a practice that continued into the 1980s with Mötley Crüe and others.''</ref> The heavy metal umlaut is never referred to by the term ''[[diaeresis]]'' in this usage, nor is it intended to affect the pronunciation of the band's name.

Heavy metal umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction. In the [[mockumentary]] film ''{{unicode|[[This Is Spinal Tap|This Is Spin̈al Tap]]}}'' (spelled with an umlaut over the ''n''), fictional rocker David St. Hubbins ([[Michael McKean]]) opines, "It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you." In 2002<!-- we're still not sure what exact issue - FIXME -->, [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']] magazine referred to the heavy metal umlaut as "the diacritical [[mark of the beast]]."

== Umlauts and diaereses ==
The German word ''Umlaut'' roughly means ''change of pronunciation'' or ''sound shift'', as it is composed of ''um-'', "around", and ''Laut'', "sound". Adding an umlaut indeed changes the pronunciation of a [[vowel]] in standard (i.e. not heavy-metal) usage; the letters ''u'' and ''ü'' represent distinct sounds, as do ''o'' vs. ''ö'' and ''a'' vs. ''ä''.

Umlauts, or visually similar [[grapheme]]s, are used in many languages, including
[[Estonian language|Estonian]],
[[Finnish language|Finnish]],
[[German language|German]],
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]],
[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]],
[[Portuguese language|Brazilian Portuguese]],
[[Swedish language|Swedish]] and
[[Turkish language|Turkish]].
The sounds represented by the umlauted letters in these languages are typically ''[[front vowel]]s'' (front [[Vowel roundedness|rounded vowels]] in the case of ''ü'' and ''ö''). Ironically, these sounds tend to be perceived as "weaker" or "lighter" than the vowels represented by un-umlauted ''u'', ''o'', and ''a'', and thus in the languages which use it normally, the umlaut does not evoke the impression of strength and darkness which its sensational use in English is intended to convey.

The English word ''[[diaeresis]]'' refers to a diacritic graphically similar to the umlaut; the name comes from a Greek word meaning "divide or distinguish". This diacritic is used in languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Portuguese language|Brazilian Portuguese]] with varying purposes. Occasionally [[English language|English]] employs a diaeresis to indicate that two [[vowel]]s are to be pronounced separately, as in the name "Chloë" or the word "naïve", or in the obsolete spellings reënact and coöperate.

== History ==

The German [[progressive rock]] band [[Amon Düül II]] (aka Amon Duul II<!--please keep aka for Google-->) released their first album in 1969. However, their name came from "[[Ammon|Amon]],  an Egyptian sun god, and [[Düül]], a character from Turkish fiction",<ref name=Amon_Düül_origin>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=B1c8j1vsjzzza | title = allmusic (((Amon Düül > Overview))) | accessmonthday = September 12|accessyear = 2006}}</ref> so this use of umlauts was not gratuitous. The third part of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s progressive rock epic "Starship Trooper" is entitled "Würm" (on [[The Yes Album]], released 1971). However, this again is probably not gratuitous, seemingly coming from the [[Würm glaciation]].

The first ''gratuitous'' use appears to have been either by [[Blue Öyster Cult]] or by [[Black Sabbath]], both in 1970. Blue Öyster Cult's website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist [[Allen Lanier]],<ref name=Blue_Öyster_1>{{cite web | url = http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html | title = BÖC Retrospectively | accessmonthday = September 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> but rock critic [[Richard Meltzer]] claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager [[Sandy Pearlman]] just after Pearlman came up with the name: "I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect anyway."<ref name=Sandy_Pearlman>{{cite web | url = http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html | title = HELL HOLES: Spin̈al Tap's main man explains the importance of the umlaut | accessmonthday = September 12|accessyear = 2006}}</ref> In that same year, Black Sabbath's record label, on a rare picture-sleeve 7" single version of [[Paranoid (song)|Paranoid]] (with the b-side [[Rat Salad]]), for no apparent reason, retitled the song "Paranoïd" with a diaeresis above the "i".<ref>[http://www.fannins-collectables.com/images/b_listing/black_sabbath/paranoid/6059014_fc-fs.jpg Paroid/Rat Salad cover]</ref>  (In French, the words ''paranoïa, paranoïaque, paranoïde'' properly have the trema.)

On their second album ''[[In Search of Space]]'' (1971), [[Hawkwind]] wrote on the backside of the cover: "{{unicode|TECHNICIÄNS ÖF SPÅCE SHIP EÅRTH THIS IS YÖÜR CÄPTÅIN SPEÄKING YÖÜR ØÅPTÅIN IS DEA˝D}}". To add to the variation, [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] letter Ø and Danish/Norwegian/Swedish letter Å are added. While the Å being a separate letter sounding like the word "Oh", the Danish Ø is actually pronounced exactly like the German and Turkish Ö. And also the diacritical mark on the last " {{unicode|A˝}} " is the "Hungarian umlaut" or [[double acute accent]] ( {{unicode|˝}} )—two short lines slanting up and to the right rather like a right double-quote mark—instead of dots (Hungarian uses neither the ( {{unicode|˝}} ) nor the traditional German umlaut ("Ä") over the letter "A", though, and ( {{unicode|˝}} ) is used only on the letters "Ő" and "Ű"). This was before [[Lemmy]], later of [[Motörhead]], had become a member of the group.

[[Motörhead]] followed in 1975. The idea for the umlaut came from [[Lemmy]], the group's lead singer, who said, "I only put it in there to look mean."<ref>[http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&articleid=21891 Motorhead Madman]</ref> (Interestingly, the German pronunciation of ''Motör'', a word that doesn't exist in German, would be similar to French equivalent, ''moteur''. "Motor", the correct German spelling, is pronounced similarly to "motor" in English, while "Motör" is similar  to "mother".) The band [[Hüsker Dü]] debuted in January of 1978, though they were based in [[punk]] and not [[heavy metal]]. [[Mötley Crüe]] formed in 1980; according to [[Vince Neil]] in the band's [[Behind the Music]] edition, the inspiration came from a [[Löwenbräu]] bottle. They subsequently decided to name their record label "[[Leathür Records]]". At one [[Mötley Crüe]] performance in Germany, the entire audience started chanting "Meutley Crew-eh" - a pronunciation often used in Hungary as well.

[[Queensrÿche]], who took on that name in 1981, went further by putting the umlaut over the ''Y'' in their name.  (In [[French language|French]], the ''ÿ'' is used very rarely, ''e.g.'' in the placename [[L'Haÿ-les-Roses]] [la'ilɛRoz],<ref>[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ha%C3%BF-les-Roses L'Haÿ-les-Roses] in French Wikipedia</ref> etc. Queensrÿche frontman [[Geoff Tate]] stated, "The umlaut over the 'y' has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it."<ref name=Sandy_Pearlman /> In contrast to other examples, the spelling of Queensrÿche was chosen to soften the band's image, as it was feared that the original spelling, Queensreich, might be misconstrued as having [[neo-nazism|neo-nazi]] connotations.<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/queensryche-faq/ Queensrÿche FAQ]</ref>

1980s [[space rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] used a variation on the concept, taking the [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] vowel ''[[ø]]'' in their name. This may have been inspired by [[computer system]]s of the time, many of which used the [[slashed zero]] as a glyph for the digit [[0 (number)|0]] to distinguish it from the letter ''[[O]]'' and thus resembled ''ø''.  The Dutch band [[Bløf]] also uses ''ø'' in its name, even though the letter is not used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; ironically, Bløf is pronounced neither ''blof'' nor ''bløf''.

The [[Parody|spoof]] band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spınal Tap]] raised the stakes in 1984 by using an [[N-diaeresis|umlaut over the letter ''n'']], i.e. over a [[consonant]] (it also makes use of a [[Dotless I|dotless i]]). This construction is in fact found in the [[Jacaltec]] language of [[Guatemala]] and in some orthographies of [[Malagasy]], a language of [[Madagascar]].

== The gratuitous umlaut in popular culture ==

* The 1974 film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' included [[Madeline Kahn]]'s German-accented [[Marlene Dietrich]]-style [[chanteuse]] character "Lili Von Shtupp" (according to the credits)<!-- which is documented by IMDb-->. She is announced on a poster outside the music hall as "Lili von Shtüpp"<!-- Hmm, my "Stüpp" informant lost confidence about the consonants on seeing the credits-->; the film's characters pronounce the name without any change to the vowel.

* In the mid-1980s, cartoonist [[Berkeley Breathed]] parodied the heavy metal umlaut in the comic strip [[Bloom County]] with the fictional group [[Deathtöngue]].  Breathed eventually had Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure from congressional hearings on "porn rock."

* In 1988, [[Jim Henson]] and [[General Foods]] released a [[breakfast cereal]], [[Cröonchy Stars]], based on the popular [[Swedish Chef]] [[muppet]].  In addition to the gratuitous umlaut in ''Cröonchy'', most of the cereal's labelling and promotional material used the idiosyncratic spelling ''{{unicode|Swed̈ish Chef}}''.<ref>[http://www.kermitage.com/html/collectibles/rarestuffnew/page3.html Crooncy Stars Cereal - General Food Corps 1988]</ref>  As with ''{{unicode|Spin̈al Tap}}'', this marks one of the rare instances of an umlaut being used over a consonant.

* The novel ''[[Zodiac (novel)|Zodiac]]'' (1988) by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a fictional metal band called Pöyzen Böyzen, which one character describes as "not bad for a two-umlaut band".

* In 1997, [[parody]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article called [http://www.theonion.com/content/node/32404 "Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts"], about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem "bad-assed and scary in a quasi-heavy metal manner".

* [[Journalist]] and [[author]] Steve Almond coined the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in 2002 to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

* Rock critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] subtitled his 2001 book ''Fargo Rock City'', ''A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta''.

* [[Webcomic]] artist [[Scott Kurtz]] drew a series of cartoons about a fake band called ''Djörk'' in his [[PvP Online]] webcomic. Apart from satirizing the heavy metal umlaut (the original band name was to be ''Umlaüt''), this name also refers to the Icelandic singer/songwriter [[Björk]], whose diacritical marks are genuine.

* The term [[nu metal]] is sometimes spelled as "nü metal".

* The video game [[Guitar Hero 2]] contains the character "Lars Ümlaüt".

* In the 2006 book "To Air Is Human", ''[[New York Times]]'' writer [[Dan Crane]] describes competing in the 2003 Air Guitar World Championships under the name Björn Türoque (a play on "Born to rock").

=== Other characters ===

* The Danish musical project [[Leæther Strip]], uses the letter [[æ]] instead of a to spell the word "leather".
* The German punk band [[Die Ärzte]] used three dots over the "A" in ''Ärzte'' on their 2003 album [[Geräusch]], to distinguish from its normal spelling with "Ä" (double dot) umlaut. This can be represented in Unicode: {{unicode|Die A⃛rzte}}. The three dots may stand for the three band members. However, the spelling "Ärzte" with two dots is not a heavy metal umlaut but the correct German spelling (meaning "The Doctors").
* A three-dot umlaut has also been seen in artwork for [[King Creosote]], over the i, as ''Ki⃛ng Cresote''.
* The American [[jam band]] [[Rusted Root]] uses a three-dot umlaut over the "e" in its logo, as seen on its [http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000001E5Z.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg album covers].
* The American thrash band [[Lååz Rockit]] actually used the letter "[[å]]" gratuitously in their logo, but the umlaut ("Lääz Rockit") in some press releases.
* The death metal band [[DÅÅTH]] also use two Å's in their name.
* The French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]] used a [[constructed language|fictional language]], the Kobaïan, for its lyrics. The umlaut appeared in several album titles, such as ''Mekanïk Destruktïw Kommandöh'' and ''Köhntarkösz''. However, this umlaut does affect pronunciation, and thus cannot be considered gratuitous. Kobaian also uses a three-dot diacritic over some letters in song titles, and an original letter that seems to be a cursive [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of "ie", which never appears without an umlaut.
* The English [[indie rock]] band [[Maxïmo Park]] also uses a double dotted "i" in its name.  It is pronounced "max-ee-moh".
* The [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]]s and [[cedilla]] in the name of the French electronica band [[Rinôçérôse]] are also gratuitous, except the "é".
* The dark folk / experimental / occult band [[Death In June]] used umlauts and accented "e"s in the original releases of their albums ''The Wörld Thät Sümmer'' (1985) and ''Thé Wäll Öf Säcrificé'' (1989) - and, on these releases, also in the band name, leading to ''Deäth In Jüne'' and ''Déäth In Jüné'', respectively.
*the Japanese rock group [[BOØWY]]. 
* The Irish electro band Klëft (also spelt with a backwards f and an inverted cross as the T)
* [[Sisqó]] (born Mark Althavan Andrews) an R&B singer and actor.
* [[Perl]] developer (Terry) Brian Ingerson legally changed his name to [[Ingy döt Net]], to match his domain name.<ref>http://blog.ingy.net/2005/11/the_ingy_formerly_known_as_bri.html</ref>
* On the cover of ''Legal Kriminal'' (1998) by [[Rasta Knast]] the title is spelled "Legål Kriminål".

=== Non-gratuitous umlauts ===

* The umlaut in [[Die Ärzte]] is correct German orthography: It's the plural of "Arzt" (doctor) and not related to the heavy metal umlaut.
* The [[Rhode Island]] "futurock" band [[Grüvis Malt]] have an umlaut in their name, but it may not be gratuitous, since it clarifies the pronunciation as "oo" rather than "uh".
* Another [[Rhode Island]] "Viking Synth Metal" band [[Vänhørwick]] use an umlaut pronounced with a strong "aan". Though the band is Swedish, it uses a Norwegian [[ø]] to be funny.
* The Icelandic artist [[Björk|Björk Guðmundsdóttir]] is using her [[Icelandic naming conventions|birth name]].
* The [[Ä]] in the Finnish heavily [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]]-influenced heavy metal band [[Teräsbetoni]] ''(reinforced concrete)'' is not gratuitous; while ''teräs'' means [[steel]] in Finnish, ''teras'' is not even a word.
* The [[Music of Japan#Japanese rock|Japanese rock]] band [[Lä-ppisch]] derives its name from the German colloquialism ''läppisch'', meaning "foolish" or "wishy-washy".<ref>[http://dict.leo.org/?lp=ende&search=l%E4ppisch&searchLoc=0&relink=on&spellToler=standard&cmpType=relaxed LEO D-E Ergebnisse für "läppisch"]</ref>
* The Danish [[spoof band]] [[Insidiöus Törment]] feature 2 umlauts in their name, though whether they are gratuitous or not is up for debate. The first functions as the umlaut in Motörhead, arguably indicating the use of the [[schwa]] (ə) in pronunciation (in both names), whereas the second -— contrary to common practice —- influences the pronunciation of "torment" so that it becomes "tørment"—using the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] or [[Faroese language|Faroese]] vowel of [[ø]].
* The Haïti Twoubadou current in [[Haitian music]] represents a legitimate use of diacritics in a musical title, because it indicates separate pronunciation of two adjacent vowels. However, this makes it not an umlaut but a [[diaeresis]]. (In [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]], ''Haïti'' is pronounced ah-ee-tee or ah-ee-tsee, with the former also being the standard [[French language|French]] pronunciation.)
* Another German band, [[Einstürzende Neubauten]] ''(collapsing new buildings)'', features an umlaut where, in German, there ought to be one.

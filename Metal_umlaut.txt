A '''heavy metal umlaut''' is an [[umlaut]] over some of the letters in the names of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. The names of bands such as [[Motörhead]], [[Mötley Crüe]] and the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] led to [[journalist]] and [[author]] [[Steve Almond]] coining the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in [[2002]] to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

The original use appears to have been by the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] in [[1971]]. [[Motörhead]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed.

[[Queensryche|Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the 'y' in their name. From a linguistic viewpoint, this might be regarded as an attempt at a [[diaresis]], rather than as an umlaut, were it not for the fact that there are no vowels to be pronounced distinctly.

Spoof band [[Spinal Tap]] parodied the idea still further by putting the umlaut over the letter 'n' (some browsers may be able to display this using Unicode: "Spin&#776;al Tap"). The n-umlaut character does not occur in any known language or belong to any standard character set.

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced [[1980s]] [[space-rock]] band Underground Zerø used a variation on the concept, using the Scandinavian vowel [[ø]] in their name.

The [[parody]] newspaper, [[The Onion]], published an article about [[George W. Bush]]'s intention to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem tougher to the rest of the world.

Recent umlaut sightings:
* the name of the band [[Assück]]
* the term "nü-metal" used to describe [[nu metal]] with added umlaut-ness.
* gay heavy metal band/cabaret act [[Pink Stëël]] have two ''consecutive'' umlauts, the first such instance in a band name
* the [[rock en espanol|Spanish band]] [[Mägo de Oz]]

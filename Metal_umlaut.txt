<!--It has been determined that the term "heavy metal umlaut" should not be hyphenated. If a change is necessary, please post it on the article's talk page. Thank you!-->
A '''heavy metal umlaut''' is an [[umlaut]] over a letter in the name of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. The use of umlauts and other [[diacritic]]s with a [[blackletter]] style [[typeface]] is a form of [[foreign branding]] intended to give a band's logo a [[Germanic]] or [[Nordic]] quality. It is a form of marketing that invokes stereotypes of boldness and strength commonly attributed to peoples such as the [[Vikings]]. The heavy metal umlaut is never referred to by the term ''[[diaeresis]]'' in this usage, nor does it affect the pronunciation of the band's name.

Heavy metal umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction. In the film ''[[Spinal Tap (band)|This Is Spın&#x308;al Tap]]'' (which is spelled with an umlaut over the 'n' and a [[dotless i]]), David St. Hubbins ([[Michael McKean]]) opined, "It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you." In [[2002]]<!-- we're still not sure what exact issue - FIXME -->, ''[[Spin magazine]]'' referred to the heavy metal umlaut as "the diacritical mark of the beast".

==Umlauts and diaereses==

The German word ''Umlaut'' roughly means ''changed sound'', as it is composed of ''um-'' (a prefix often used with verbs involving "change") and ''Laut'', here meaning "sound".  Adding an umlaut indeed changes the pronunciation of a [[vowel]] in standard (non-heavy metal) usage; the letters ''u'' and ''ü'' represent distinct sounds, as do  ''o'' vs. ''ö'' and ''a'' vs. ''ä''.  
Umlauts are used in several languages, such as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The sounds represented by the umlauted letters in these languages are typically ''[[front vowel]]s'' (front [[Vowel roundedness|rounded vowels]] in the case of ''ü'' and ''ö''). Ironically, these sounds tend to be perceived as  "weaker" or "lighter" than the vowels represented by un-umlautted ''u'', ''o'', and ''a'', thus failing to create the intended impression of strength and darkness.

The English word ''[[diaeresis]]'' refers to a diacritic graphically similar to the umlaut; the name comes from a Greek word meaning "divide or distinguish".  This diacritic is used in languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and occasionally [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]] to indicate that two [[vowel]]s are to be pronounced separately, as in the name "Chloë" or the word "naïve".

==History==

The [[progressive rock]] band [[Amon Düül II]] (aka Amon Duul II<!--please keep aka for Google-->) released their first album in [[1969]]. However, their name came from "[[Ammon|Amon]]  an Egyptian sun god and [[Düül]] a character from Turkish fiction" [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDMISS70406050306300345&sql=B1c8j1vsjzzza], so this use of diaereses was not gratuitous.

The first ''gratuitous'' use appears to have been by the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] in [[1970]]. The band's website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist [[Allen Lanier]] [http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html], but rock critic [[Richard Meltzer]] claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager [[Sandy Pearlman]] just after Pearlman came up with the name: "I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect anyway." [http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html]

On their second album ''[[In Search of Space]]'' (1971), [[Hawkwind]] wrote on the backside of the cover: "{{unicode|TECHNICIÄNS ÖF SPÅCE SHIP EÅRTH THIS IS YÖÜR CÄPTÅIN SPEÄKING YÖÜR ØÅPTÅIN IS DEA&#x030B;D}}". To add to the variation, the diacritical mark on the last "{{unicode|A&#x030B;}}" is the "Hungarian umlaut" or [[double acute accent]] ({{unicode|&#x2dd;}})&mdash;two short lines slanting up and to the right rather like a right double-quote mark&mdash;instead of dots (Hungarian does not use the (¨) umlaut over the letter "A", though). This was before [[Lemmy Kilmister]], later of [[Motörhead]], had become a member of the group.

Motörhead and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed. The umlaut in ''Motörhead'' was contributed by the graphic designer of the band's first album cover.  In the words of Lemmy, Motörhead's front man: "I only put it in there to look mean." [http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&articleid=21891] (Interestingly, the standard German pronunciation of ''Motor'' is similar to the standard English pronunciation of "motor", the umlaut over the second "o" requiring, in German, the fronting of the vowel. The French equivalent, ''moteur'', is genuinely pronounced that way.)
At one [[Mötley Crüe]] performance in Germany, the entire audience started chanting "Moetley Crueh!"

[[Image:Spinal Tap logo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Spinal Tap|Spinal Tap]] used the umlaut in an unexpected place &mdash; above a consonant.]]

[[Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the ''Y'' in their name.  (The symbol ''ÿ'' is sometimes used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] handwriting to display the [[IJ (letter)|letter IJ]] instead of IJ/ij, and, very rarely, in [[French language|French]], ''e.g.'', in the Belgian-French composer [[Eugène Ysaÿe]], in the placename L'Haÿ-les-Roses [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ha%C3%BF-les-Roses], etc.)  Queensr&yuml;che frontman [[Geoff Tate]] stated, "The umlaut over the 'y' has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it."[http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html]

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced [[1980s]] [[space-rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] used a variation on the concept, using the [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] vowel ''[[ø]]'' in their name. This may have been inspired by [[computer system]]s of the time, many of which used the [[slashed zero]] as a glyph for the digit [[0 (number)|0]] to distinguish it from the letter [[O]] and thus resembled ''ø''.

The [[spoof]] band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spin&#x308;al Tap]] raised the stakes in [[1982]] by using an umlaut over the letter ''N'', a [[consonant]]. This is a construction only found in the [[Jacaltec]] language of [[Guatemala]] and in some orthographies of [[Malagasy]], although it is unlikely that the writers of ''This Is Spin&#x308;al Tap'' knew this at the time.

==The heavy metal umlaut in popular literature==

In the mid-1980s, cartoonist [[Berkeley Breathed]] parodied the heavy metal umlaut in the comic strip [[Bloom County]] with the fictional group [[Billy and the Boingers|Deathtöngue]], fronted by the depraved and unwholesome singer/'lead tongue' [[Bill the Cat|"Wild" Bill Catt]] and infamous for the songs "Let's Run Over [[Lionel Richie]] With a Tank", "[[Clearasil]] [[Messiah]]" and "U Stink But I Love U".  Breathed eventually had Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure from congressional hearings on "porn rock" led by one "Tippy Gorp", an obvious reference to heavy metal [[bête noire]] [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]].

In [[1988]], [[Jim Henson]] and [[General Foods]] released a [[breakfast cereal]], [[Cröonchy Stars]], based on the popular [[Swedish Chef]] [[muppet]].  In addition to the gratuitous umlaut in ''Cröonchy'', most of the cereal's labelling and promotional material used the idiosyncratic spelling ''Swed&#x308;ish Chef''. [http://www.kermitage.com/html/collectibles/rarestuffnew/page3.html]  As with ''Spin&#x308;al Tap'', this marks one of the rare instances of an umlaut being used over a consonant.

The novel ''[[Zodiac (book)|Zodiac]]'' (1988) by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a fictional band called P&ouml;yzen B&ouml;yzen, which one character describes as "not bad for a two-umlaut band".

In [[1997]], [[parody]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article called "Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts", about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem "bad-assed and scary in a quasi-heavy metal manner".

[[Journalist]] and [[author]] Steve Almond coined the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in [[2002]] to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

Rock critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] subtitled his [[2003]] book ''Fargo Rock City'' with ''A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta''.

[[Webcomic]] artist [[Scott Kurtz]] drew a series of cartoons about a fake band called ''Djörk'' in his [http://www.pvponline.com/index.php3 ''PvP Online''] webcomic. Apart from possibly satirizing the heavy metal umlaut, this name also refers to the Icelandic singer/songwriter [[Björk]] Guðmundsdóttir, whose umlaut is genuine.

* The Finnish hardcore punk band [[Ümlaut]] (this use is almost a [[self-reference]]).
* [[Zee (band)|Zee]], a short-lived band formed by [[Pink Floyd]] keyboard player [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] and [[Dave Harris]], made excessive use of gratuitous umlauts on their 1984 album ''[[Identity (album)|Identity]]'' which included song titles such as "Cönfüsiön" and "Höw Dö Yöü Dö It".

===Other characters===

* The German punk band [[Die Ärzte]] used three dots (triaeresis?) over the "A" in ''Ärzte'' to distinguish from its normal spelling with "Ä" (double dot) diaeresis. This can be represented in Unicode: {{unicode|Die A&#8411;rzte}}. The three dots may stand for the three band members.
* The American thrash band [[Lååz Rockit]] actually used the letter "[[Å|å]]" gratuitously in their logo, but the umlaut ("Lääz Rockit") in some press releases.
* The French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]] used a [[constructed language | fictional language]], the Kobaïan, for its lyrics. The umlaut appeared in several album titles, such as ''Mekanïk Destruktïw Kommandöh'' and ''Köhntarkösz''. However, this umlaut does affect pronunciation, and thus cannot be considered gratuitous. Kobaian also uses a three-dot diacritic over some letters in song titles, and an original letter that seems to be a cursive [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of "ie", which never appears without an umlaut.
* The English [[indie rock]] band [[Maxïmo Park]] also uses a double dotted "i" in its name.
* The [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]]s and [[cedilla]] in the name of the French electronica band [[Rinôçérôse]] are also gratuitous.
*[[William Orbit|William Ørbit]].
* The dark folk / experimental / occult band [[Death In June]] used umlauts (and in the second case, even accented e's) in the original releases of their albums ''The Wörld Thät Sümmer'' (1985) and ''Thé Wäll Öf Säcrificé'' (1989) - and, on these releases, also in the band name, leading to ''Deäth In Jüne'' and ''Déäth In Jüné'', respectively.
*the Japanese rock group [[BOØWY]].

===Non-gratuitous umlauts===

* The US [[punk rock]] band [[Hüsker Dü]] took their name from a [[Husker Du? (game)|children's memory game]], which added [[macron]]s over each u in the phrase, replacing these macrons with umlauts. Without the umlauts, "husker du" is a [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] phrase meaning "Do you remember".
* The name of the [[Toronto, Ontario]] area folk-pop/geek-rock band [[Moxy Früvous]] is pronounced with long-u, "Fruuvous", so this is perhaps not gratuitous.
* The [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Trojan (band)|Trojan]] used umlauts in their name on the 1985 release ''Chasing the Storm''. For [[Sweden|Swedes]] the tour T-shirts from this time are particularly amusing, as "Tröjan" in Swedish translates as "the shirt".
* The [[Rhode Island]] "futurock" band [[Grüvis Malt]] have an umlaut in their name, but it may not be gratuitous, since it clarifies the pronunciation as "oo" rather than "uh".
*The [[San Francisco]] band [[Children of Umlaut]] do not in fact have an umlaut in their name.
* The Icelandic artist [[Björk]] Guðmundsdóttir is using her birth name.
* The [[Ä]] in the Finnish heavily [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]]-influenced heavy metal band [[Teräsbetoni]] ''(reinforced concrete)'' is not gratuitous; while ''teräs'' means [[steel]] in Finnish, ''teras'' is not even a word.
* The [[J-Rock|Japanese rock]] band [[Lä-ppisch]] derives its name from the German colloquialism ''läppisch'', meaning "laughable".
* Danish [[spoof band]] [http://www.insidioustorment.com Insidiöus Törment] feature 2 umlauts in their name, though whether they are gratuitous or not is up for debate. The first functions as the umlaut in Motörhead, arguably indicating the use of schwa (&#399;) in pronunciation (in both names), whereas the second - contrary to common practice - influences the pronunciation of "torment" so that it becomes "tørment" - using the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] or [[Faroese]] vowel of [[ø]].
* The Haïti Twoubadou current in [[Haitian music]] represents another legitimate use of umlauts in a musical title, because it indicates separate pronunciation of two adjacent vowels. (Pronounced ha-ee-tee or ha-ee-tsee)
* Norwegian electronica duo [[Röyksopp]] spell their name with a Swedish-influenced [[ö]] rather than the proper Norwegian [[ø]]; however, the umlaut is not gratuitous, as 'røyksopp' is Norwegian for 'smoke mushroom'.

The use of an [[umlaut]] over some of the letters in the names of the [[heavy metal]] bands [[Motörhead]], [[Mötley Crüe]] and the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] has led to [[journalist]] and [[author]] [[Steve Almond]] coining the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

Spoof band [[Spinal Tap]] ridiculed the idea still further by putting the umlaut over the letter 'n'. The n-umlaut character does not belong to any standard character set, so this cannot easily be illustrated here.

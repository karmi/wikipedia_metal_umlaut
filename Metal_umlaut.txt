A '''heavy metal umlaut''' is an [[umlaut]] or a [[diaeresis]] (though always called an ''umlaut'' in this usage) over some of the letters in the name of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band &mdash; without regard for the actual [[pronunciation]] of the name.

Umlauts are often used in concert with a [[Blackletter]] or  pseudo-Blackletter [[typeface]] in the band logo to give it a more [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]ian feel. Many bands have taken to using umlauts and other [[diacritic]]s, often gratuitously, in their names.

''Spin'' magazine referred to the heavy metal umlaut as ''"the diacritical mark of the beast."'' As David St. Hubbins ([[Michael McKean]]) of the fictional rock band [[Spinal Tap]] puts it in the film of the same name: ''"It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you."''

==History==

The [[progressive rock]] band [[Amon Düül]] released their first album in [[1969]]. However, their name came from ''"Amon being an Egyptian sun god, [[Düül]] a character from Turkish fiction"'' [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDMISS70406050306300345&sql=B1c8j1vsjzzza], so this use of diaereses was not gratuitous.

The first ''gratuitous'' use appears to have been by the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] in [[1970]]. The band's site states it was added by [[Allen Lanier]] [http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html], but rock critic [[Richard Meltzer]] claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager [[Sandy Pearlman]]: ''"I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O? Metal had a Wagnerian aspect anyway."''

[[Mot&ouml;rhead]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed. The umlaut in "Mot&ouml;rhead" was in fact a creation of the graphic designer responsible for the first album cover, because ''"it looks mean."'' The usage stuck.

[[Image:Spinal Tap logo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Spinal Tap]] used the umlaut in an unexpected place &mdash; above a consonant.]]

[[Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the "y" in their name.  (It is sometimes used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to display the [[Dutch Y]] instead of IJ/ij when the real letters "&#306;" and "&#307;" are unavailable.) From a linguistic viewpoint, this might be regarded as an attempt at a diaeresis, rather than as an umlaut, were it not that there are no vowels to be pronounced distinctly. Frontman [[Geoff Tate]] said, ''"We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it."''

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced [[1980s]] [[space-rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] used a variation on the concept, using the Scandinavian vowel [[ø]] in their name.

The [[spoof]] band Spinal Tap raised the stakes in [[1982]] by using an umlaut over the letter "n" (<math> \mathbf{\ddot{n}}</math>), a [[consonant]]. Obscurely, this is a construction only found in the [[Jacaltec]] language of [[Guatemala]]. St. Hubbins stated: ''"[[René Magritte|Ceci n'est pas un umlaut]]."''

==The heavy metal umlaut in popular literature==

In the mid-1980s, cartoonist Berke Breathed parodied the heavy metal umlaut in the comic strip [[Bloom County]] with the fictional group Deathtöngue, fronted by the depraved and unwholesome singer/'lead tongue' [[Bill the Cat|"Wild" Bill Catt]] and infamous for the songs "Let's Run Over Lionel Richie With a Tank" and "U Stink But I Love U".  Breathed eventually had Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure from congressional hearings on "porn rock" led by one "Tippy Gorp", an obvious reference to heavy metal [[bête noire]] [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[PMRC]].

The novel ''[[Zodiac (book)|Zodiac]]'' (1988) by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a fictional band called P&ouml;yzen B&ouml;yzen, who another character describes as ''"pretty good for a two-umlaut band."''

In 1997, [[parody]] newspaper [[The Onion]] published an article called ''Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts'', about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem tougher to the rest of the world.

[[Journalist]] and [[author]] [[Steve Almond]] coined the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in [[2002]] to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

Rock critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] subtitled his [[2003]] book ''Fargo Rock City'' with ''A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta''.

==Other musical usages of gratuitous diacritics==

* the [[Florida]] [[grindcore]] band [[Assück]].
* the [[Music of Australia|Australia]]n [[thrash metal|black/thrash metal]] band [[Deströyer 666]]
* the German punk band [[Die Ärzte]] used three dots (triaeresis?) over the "A" in ''Ärzte'' to distinguish from its normal spelling with a (double dot) diaeresis. This can be represented in Unicode: Die A&#8411;rzte.
* [[D&uuml;rty Nelly's Pub]], a rock bar in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].
* the [[punk rock]] band [[Hüsker Dü]]. The name is a [[Danish language|Danish]] phrase meaning "Do you remember?". However, ü is not used in Danish and the correct phrase would be "husker du?" The band took their name from a [[Husker Du? (game)|children's memory game]], which added [[macron]]s over each u in the phrase, replacing these macrons with umlauts.
* the French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]] used a fictional language, the Kobaïan, for its lyrics. The umlaut appeared in several album titles, such as ''Mekanïk Destruktïw Kommandöh'' and ''Köhntarkösz''.
* the [[rock en espanol|Spanish band]] [[Mägo de Oz]].
* the term "nü-metal," used to describe [[nu metal]] with added umlautness.
* gay heavy metal band/cabaret act [[Pink Stëël]] have two ''consecutive'' gratuitous umlauts, the first such instance in a band name. <!-- documentation please! The library/scifi metal band [[Bl&ouml;&ouml;dhag]] also have consecutive umlauts.-->
* the accents in the name of the French electronica band [[Rinôçérôse]] are also gratuitous.
* [[heavy metal]] band [[Trojan (band)|Trojan]] used umlauts in their name on the 1985 release ''Chasing the Storm''. For [[Sweden|Swedes]] the tour T-shirts from this time are particularly amusing, as "Tröjan" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] translates as "the shirt".
* the Finnish hardcore punk band [[Ümlaut]].

The [[San Francisco]] band [[Children of Umlaut]] do not in fact have an umlaut in their name.

==Commercial uses of gratuitous diacritics==

The heavy metal umlaut is unrelated to the use of spurious diacritics in the name of such products as [[H&auml;agen-Dazs]] [[ice cream]] (originating in [[New York]] in [[1961]]) to market a local product as [[Europe]]an.

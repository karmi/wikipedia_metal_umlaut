The [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] is sometimes used gratuitously or decoratively over letters in the names of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, such as in [[Mötley Crüe]] or [[Motörhead]]. The use of umlauts and other [[diacritic]]s with a [[blackletter]] style [[typeface]] is a form of [[foreign branding]] intended to give a band's logo a [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] quality. It is a form of marketing that evokes stereotypes of boldness and strength commonly attributed to peoples such as the [[Vikings]]; author Reebee Garofalo has attributed its use to a desire for a "[[Gothic horror]]" feel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garofalo, Rebee|title=Rockin' Out: Popular Music in the USA|publisher=Allyn & Bacon|year=1997|id=ISBN 0-205-13703-2 |page=292}} "Some groups, for example Blue Öyster Cult and Motörhead, added gratuitous umlauts to their names to conjure up a more generic gothic horror, a practice that continued into the 1980s with Mötley Crüe and others."</ref> The heavy metal umlaut is never referred to by the term ''[[diaeresis]]'' in this usage, nor is it generally intended to affect the pronunciation of the band's name.

Heavy metal umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction. In the [[mockumentary]] film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap|This Is Spı{{Unicode|n̈}}al Tap]]'' (spelled with an umlaut over the ''n''), fictional rocker David St. Hubbins ([[Michael McKean]]) says, "It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you." In 2002<!-- we're still not sure what exact issue - FIXME -->, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine referred to the heavy metal umlaut as "the diacritical [[mark of the beast]]."{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

== Umlauts and diaereses ==
The German word ''Umlaut'' roughly means ''change of pronunciation'' or ''sound shift'', as it is composed of ''um-'', "re-", and ''Laut'', "sound". Adding an umlaut indeed changes the pronunciation of a [[vowel]] in standard (i.e. not heavy-metal) usage; the letters ''u'' and ''ü'' represent distinct sounds, as do ''o'' vs. ''ö'' and ''a'' vs. ''ä''.

Umlauts, or visually similar [[grapheme]]s, are used in many languages, including
[[Estonian language|Estonian]],
[[Finnish language|Finnish]],
[[German language|German]],
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]],
[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]],
[[Swedish language|Swedish]] and
[[Turkish language|Turkish]].
The sounds represented by the umlauted letters in these languages are typically ''[[front vowel]]s'' (front [[Vowel roundedness|rounded vowels]] in the case of ''ü'' and ''ö''). Ironically, these sounds tend to be perceived as "weaker" or "lighter" than the vowels represented by un-umlauted ''u'', ''o'', and ''a'', and thus in the languages which use it normally, the umlaut does not evoke the impression of strength and darkness which its sensational use in English is intended to convey.

The English word ''[[diaeresis]]'', coming from a Greek word meaning "to divide or distinguish", refers to a diacritic graphically similar to the umlaut. This diacritic is used in languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and [[Portuguese language|Brazilian Portuguese]] with varying purposes; in [[English language|English]] and some other languages the diaeresis may be employed to indicate that two [[vowel]]s are to be pronounced separately, as in the names "Chloë," "Zoë," or the word "naïve". Although spellings such as reënact and coöperate have largely fallen into disuse, this use of the [[Umlaut (diacritic)#Diaeresis or trema|diaeresis mark]], or trema, is still used in some English-language publications.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary (2004, CD).</ref>

== History ==
The German [[progressive rock]] band [[Amon Düül II]] released their first album in 1969. However, their name came from "[[Ammon|Amon]],  an Egyptian sun god, and [[Düül]], a character from Turkish fiction",<ref name=Amon_Düül_origin>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=B1c8j1vsjzzza | title = Amon Düül | accessmonthday = September 12|accessyear = 2006 |publisher=allmusic.com |author=John Bush}}</ref> so this use of umlauts was not [[wikt:gratuitous|gratuitous]]. The third part of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s progressive rock epic "Starship Trooper" is entitled "Würm" (on [[The Yes Album]], released 1971). However, this again is probably not gratuitous, seemingly coming from the [[Würm glaciation]].

The first ''gratuitous'' use appears to have been either by [[Blue Öyster Cult]] or by [[Black Sabbath]], both in 1970. Blue Öyster Cult's website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist [[Allen Lanier]],<ref name=Blue_Öyster_1>{{cite web | url = http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html | title = BÖC Retrospectively: Stalk Forrest Group 1969-1970 | accessmonthday = September 12 | accessyear = 2006 |publisher=blueoystercult.com}}</ref> but rock critic [[Richard Meltzer]] claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager [[Sandy Pearlman]] just after Pearlman came up with the name: "I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect anyway."<ref name=Sandy_Pearlman>{{cite web | url = http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html | title = Hell Holes: Spin̈al Tap's main man explains the importance of the umlaut | accessmonthday = September 12|accessyear = 2006 |author=Lisa Gidley |publisher=CMJ |date=2000}}</ref> In that same year, Black Sabbath's record label, on a rare picture-sleeve 7" single version of [[Paranoid (song)|Paranoid]] (with the b-side [[Rat Salad]]), for no apparent reason, retitled the song "Paranoïd" with a diaeresis above the "i" (as is correct in French).<ref>[http://www.fannins-collectables.com/images/b_listing/black_sabbath/paranoid/6059014_fc-fs.jpg ''Black Sabbath'' - Paranoid/Rat Salad cover], retrieved December 29, 2007</ref>

On their second album ''[[In Search of Space]]'' (1971), [[Hawkwind]] wrote on the backside of the cover: "{{unicode|TECHNICIÄNS ÖF SPÅCE SHIP EÅRTH THIS IS YÖÜR CÄPTÅIN SPEÄKING YÖÜR ØÅPTÅIN IS DEA̋D}}". To add to the variation, [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] letter Ø and Danish/Norwegian/Swedish letter Å are added. The diacritical mark on the last " {{unicode|A̋}} " is the "Hungarian umlaut" or [[double acute accent]] (&nbsp;{{unicode|˝}}&nbsp;)—two short lines slanting up and to the right—instead of dots (Hungarian uses neither the (&nbsp;{{unicode|˝}}&nbsp;) nor the traditional German umlaut ("Ä") over the letter "A", though, and (&nbsp;{{unicode|˝}}&nbsp;) is used only on the letters "Ő" and "Ű"). This was before [[Lemmy]], later of [[Motörhead]], had become a member of the group.

[[Motörhead]] followed in 1975. The idea for the umlaut came from [[Lemmy]], the group's lead singer, who said, "I only put it in there to look mean."<ref>[http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&articleid=21891 "Motorhead Madman: Witness this: We interviewed the most seasoned rocker rocking the rock in rock business today"], ''Wave'' magazine, 2002, retrieved December 29, 2007</ref> (Interestingly, the German pronunciation of ''Motör'', a word that does not exist in German, would be similar to French equivalent, ''moteur''. "Motor", the correct German spelling, is pronounced similarly to "motor" in English.) The band [[Hüsker Dü]] debuted in January of 1979, though they were based in [[Punk rock|punk]] and not [[heavy metal]]. Hüsker Dü's name is derived from the name of a Danish board game which translates to "Do you remember?" [[Mötley Crüe]] formed in 1980; according to [[Vince Neil]] in the band's [[Behind the Music]] edition, the inspiration came from a [[Löwenbräu]] bottle. They subsequently decided to name their record label "[[Leathür Records]]". At one [[Mötley Crüe]] performance in Germany, the entire audience started chanting "Meutley Crew-eh" ({{IPA2|møːt.liː kʁyː.ə}}) &mdash; a pronunciation often used in Hungary as well.

[[Queensrÿche]], who took on that name in 1981, went further by putting the umlaut over the ''Y'' in their name.  (In [[French language|French]], the ''ÿ'' is used very rarely, ''e.g.'' in the placename [[L'Haÿ-les-Roses]] ({{IPA2|la.ˈi.lɛ.ʀoz}}),<ref>[[:fr:L'Haÿ-les-Roses|L'Haÿ-les-Roses]] in French Wikipedia</ref> etc.) Queensrÿche frontman [[Geoff Tate]] stated, "The umlaut over the 'y' has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it."<ref name=Sandy_Pearlman /> In contrast to other examples, the spelling of Queensrÿche was chosen to soften the band's image, as it was feared that the original spelling, Queensreich, might be misconstrued as having [[neo-nazism|neo-nazi]] connotations.<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/queensryche-faq/ "Queensrÿche FAQ"], Dan Birchall,  Version 3.01, October 30, 1994, retrieved December 29, 2007</ref>

[[Image:Spinal Tap logo.jpg|thumb|The mockumentary ''[[This Is Spinal Tap|This Is Spı{{Unicode|n̈}}al Tap]]'' parodies the Heavy Metal Umlaut by putting an umlaut on the "n" in Spı{{Unicode|n̈}}al Tap]]
The [[Parody|spoof]] band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spı{{Unicode|n̈}}al Tap]] raised the stakes in 1984 by using an [[N-diaeresis|umlaut over the letter ''n'']]; i.e., over a [[consonant]]. This construction is in fact found in the [[Jakaltek language|Jakaltek]] language of [[Guatemala]] and in some orthographies of [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], a language of [[Madagascar]].

==Popular culture usage ==
The 1974 film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' included [[Madeline Kahn]]'s German-accented [[Marlene Dietrich]]-style [[chanteuse]] character "Lili Von Shtupp" (according to the credits)<!-- which is documented by IMDb-->. She is announced on a poster outside the music hall as "Lili von Shtüpp"<!-- Hmm, my "Stüpp" informant lost confidence about the consonants on seeing the credits-->; the film's characters pronounce the name without any change to the vowel. The name itself is clearly intended as an allusion to [[Yiddish]], which is used elsewhere throughout the movie, rather than German. In Yiddish, ''[[wikt:shtup|shtup]]'', probably derived from the German for "push," is a vulgarism meaning "to have sex with."

In the mid-1980s, cartoonist [[Berkeley Breathed]] parodied the heavy metal umlaut in the comic strip [[Bloom County]] with the fictional group [[Deathtöngue]].  Breathed eventually had Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure, in the strip, from congressional hearings on "[[Parents Music Resource Center#Senate_hearing|porn rock]]."

The novel ''[[Zodiac (novel)|Zodiac]]'' (1988) by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a fictional metal band called Pöyzen Böyzen, which one character describes as "not bad for a two-umlaut band".<ref name="stephenson">Stephenson, N. (1988).  ''Zodiac'', p.  105.  New York:  Grove Press.  ISBN 0-8021-4315-6</ref>

In 1997, [[parody]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article called [http://www.theonion.com/content/node/32404 "Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts"], about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem "bad-assed and scary in a quasi-heavy metal manner". [[Journalist]] and author [[Steve Almond]] coined the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in 2002 to describe the heavy metal touring scene. Rock critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] subtitled his 2001 book ''[[Fargo Rock City]]'', ''A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta''.

[[Webcomic]] artist [[Scott Kurtz]] drew a series of cartoons about a fake band called ''Djörk'' in his [[PvP Online]] webcomic. Apart from satirizing the heavy metal umlaut (the original band name was to be ''Umlaüt''), this name also refers to the Icelandic singer/songwriter [[Björk]], whose diacritical marks are genuine. The term [[nu metal]] is sometimes spelled as "nü metal". The video games [[Guitar Hero 2]] and [[Guitar Hero 3]] contain the character "Lars Ümlaüt". In the 2006 book "To Air Is Human", ''[[New York Times]]'' writer [[Dan Crane]] describes competing in the 2003 Air Guitar World Championships under the name Björn Türoque (a play on "Born to rock"). In October 2007, [[LucasArts]] [[alumnus]] [[Tim Schafer]] announced his newest project, the heavy metal [[adventure game]] ''[[Brütal Legend]]''.

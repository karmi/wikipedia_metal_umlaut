The use of an [[umlaut]] over some of the letters in the names of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Motörhead]], [[Mötley Crüe]] and the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] has led to [[journalist]] and [[author]] [[Steve Almond]] coining the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in [[2002]] to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

The original use appears to have been by the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] in [[1971]]. [[Motörhead]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed.

[[Queensryche|Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the 'y' in their name. From a linguistic viewpoint, this might be regarded as an attempt at a [[diaresis]], rather than as an umlaut, were it not for the fact that there are no vowels to be pronounced distinctly.

Spoof band [[Spinal Tap]] ridiculed the idea still further by putting the umlaut over the letter 'n' (not shown here due to limitations of some browsers). The n-umlaut character does not occur in any known language or belong to any standard character set.

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced [[1980s]] [[space-rock]] band Underground Zerø used a variation on the concept, using the Scandinavian vowel [[Ø]] in their name.

Recent umlaut sightings:
* the name of the band [[Assück]]
* the term "nü-metal" used to describe [[nu-metal]] with added umlaut-ness.
* gay heavy metal band [[Pink Stëël]] have two ''consecutive'' umlauts, the first such instance in a band name

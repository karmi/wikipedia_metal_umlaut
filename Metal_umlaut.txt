A '''heavy metal umlaut''' is an [[umlaut]] (not to be confused with a  [[diaeresis]], the name given to the same symbol when used on the second of two vowels to show that both are pronounced) over some of the letters in the names of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band &mdash; although the names will then sound very silly to people who use languages in which umlauts are common, such as [[German language|German]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

Umlauts are often used in concert with a [[Blackletter]] or  pseudo-Blackletter [[typeface]] in the band logo to give it a more [[gothic]] feel. Many bands have taken to using umlauts and other [[diacritic]]s, often gratuitously, in their names.

==History==

The first use appears to have been by the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] in [[1971]]. [[Mot&ouml;rhead]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed.

The umlaut in "Mot&ouml;rhead" was in fact a creation of the graphic designer responsible for the first album cover. 

[[Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the "y" in their name.  (It is sometimes used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to display the [[Dutch Y]] instead of IJ/ij when the real letters "&#306;" and "&#307;" are unavailable.) From a linguistic viewpoint, this might be regarded as an attempt at a diaeresis, rather than as an umlaut, were it not that there are no vowels to be pronounced distinctly.

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced [[1980s]] [[space-rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] used a variation on the concept, using the Scandinavian vowel [[ø]] in their name.

The [[spoof]] band [[Spinal Tap]] played on the odd use of umlauts in [[1982]] by using an umlaut over the letter "n", a character only found in the [[Jacaltec]] language.

==The heavy metal umlaut in popular literature==

In the mid-1980s, cartoonist Berke Breathed parodied the Gothic umlaut in the comic strip [[Bloom County]] with the fictional group Deathtöngue, fronted by the depraved and unwholesome singer/'lead tongue' [[Bill the Cat|"Wild" Bill Catt]] and infamous for the songs "Let's Run Over Lionel Richie With a Tank" and "U Stink But I Love U".  Breathed eventually has Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure from congressional hearings on porn rock led by one "Tippy Gorp", an obvious reference to heavy metal bête noire [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[PMRC]].

The novel ''[[Zodiac (book)|Zodiac]]'' (1988) by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a fictional band called P&ouml;yzen B&ouml;yzen, who another character describes as ''"pretty good for a two-umlaut band."''

In 1997, the [[parody]] newspaper, [[The Onion]], published an article entitled "Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts", about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem tougher to the rest of the world.

[[Journalist]] and [[author]] [[Steve Almond]] coined the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in [[2002]] to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

==Other musical usages of diacritics==

* the Australian [[thrash metal|black/trash metal]] band [[Deströyer 666]]
* the Finnish punk hardcore band Ümlaut.
* the name of the band [[Assück]].
* the [[punk rock]] band [[Hüsker Dü]]. (The name is a [[Danish language|Danish]] phrase meaning "Do you remember?". However, ü is not used in Danish and the correct phrase would be "husker du?" The band took their name from a [[Husker Du? (game)|children's memory game]], which added [[macron]]s over each u in the phrase, replacing these macrons with umlauts.)
* [[heavy metal]] band [[Trojan]] used umlauts in their name on the 1985 release ''Chasing the Storm''. (For Swedes the tour T-shirts from this time are particularly amusing, as "Tröjan" in Swedish translates as "the shirt".)
* the term "nü-metal" used to describe [[nu metal]] with added umlautness.
* gay heavy metal band/cabaret act [[Pink Stëël]] have two ''consecutive'' umlauts, the first such instance in a band name.
* the [[rock en espanol|Spanish band]] [[Mägo de Oz]].
* the German punk band [[Die Ärzte]] used three dots (triaresis?) over the "A" in ''Ärzte''. This can be represented in Unicode: Die A&#8411;rzte.
* the French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]] used a fictional language, the Kobaïan, for its lyrics. The umlaut appeared in several album titles ("Mekanïk Destruktïw Kommandöh" or "Köhntarkösz" for instance).
* the accents in the name of the French electronica band [[Rinôçérôse]] are also gratuitous.

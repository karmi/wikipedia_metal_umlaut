<!--It has been determined that the term "heavy metal umlaut" should not be hyphenated. If a change is necessary, please post it on the article's talk page. Thank you!-->

A '''heavy metal umlaut''' (aka '''röck döts''') is an [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] over a letter in the name of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. The use of umlauts and other [[diacritic]]s with a [[blackletter]] style [[typeface]] is a form of [[foreign branding]] intended to give a band's logo a [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] quality. It is a form of marketing that evokes stereotypes of boldness and strength commonly attributed to peoples such as the [[Vikings]]; author Reebee Garofalo has attributed its use to a desire for a "[[gothic horror]]" feel.<ref>Garofalo, pg. 292 <small>''Some groups, for example Blue Öyster Cult and Motörhead, added gratuitous umlauts to their names to conjure up a more generic gothic horror, a practice that continued into the 1980s with Mötley Crüe and others.''</ref> The heavy metal umlaut is never referred to by the term ''[[diaeresis]]'' in this usage, nor is it intended to affect the pronunciation of the band's name.

Heavy metal umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction. In the film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (spelled with an umlaut over the ''n''), David St. Hubbins ([[Michael McKean]]) opined, "It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you." In 2002<!-- we're still not sure what exact issue - FIXME -->, [[Spin magazine|''Spin'' magazine]] referred to the heavy metal umlaut as "the diacritical mark of the beast".

== Umlauts and diaereses ==

The German word ''Umlaut'' roughly means ''changed sound'', as it is composed of ''um-'' (a prefix often used with verbs involving "twist") and ''Laut'', here meaning "sound".  Adding an umlaut indeed changes the pronunciation of a [[vowel]] in standard (i.e. not heavy-metal) usage; the letters ''u'' and ''ü'' represent distinct sounds, as do  ''o'' vs. ''ö'' and ''a'' vs. ''ä''.

Umlauts, or visually similar [[grapheme]]s, are used in several languages, such as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The sounds represented by the umlauted letters in these languages are typically ''[[front vowel]]s'' (front [[Vowel roundedness|rounded vowels]] in the case of ''ü'' and ''ö''). Ironically, these sounds tend to be perceived as  "weaker" or "lighter" than the vowels represented by un-umlauted ''u'', ''o'', and ''a'', thus failing to create the intended impression of strength and darkness.

The English word ''[[diaeresis]]'' refers to a diacritic graphically similar to the umlaut; the name comes from a Greek word meaning "divide or distinguish".  This diacritic is used in languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with varying purposes.  Occasionally [[English language|English]] employs a diaeresis to indicate that two [[vowel]]s are to be pronounced separately, as in the name "Chloë" or the word "naïve".

== History ==

The German [[progressive rock]] band [[Amon Düül II]] (aka Amon Duul II<!--please keep aka for Google-->) released their first album in 1969. However, their name came from "[[Ammon|Amon]],  an Egyptian sun god, and [[Düül]], a character from Turkish fiction",[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=B1c8j1vsjzzza] so this use of diaereses was not gratuitous. The third part of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s progressive rock epic "Starship Trooper" is entitled "Würm" (on [[The Yes Album]], released 1971). However, this again is probably not gratuitous, seemingly coming from the [[Würm glaciation]].

The first ''gratuitous'' use appears to have been either by [[Blue Öyster Cult]] or by [[Black Sabbath]], both in 1970. Blue Öyster Cult's website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist [[Allen Lanier]],[http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html] but rock critic [[Richard Meltzer]] claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager [[Sandy Pearlman]] just after Pearlman came up with the name: "I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect anyway."[http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html] Conversely, Black Sabbath, on a rare 7" single version of [[Paranoid (song)|Paranoid]] (with the b-side [[Rat Salad]]), for no forthcoming reason, renamed the single "Paranoïd" with a diaeresis above the "i".[http://www.fannins-collectables.com/images/b_listing/black_sabbath/paranoid/6059014_fc-fs.jpg]  (In French, the words ''paranoïa, paranoïaque, paranoïde'' properly have the trema.)

On their second album ''[[In Search of Space]]'' (1971), [[Hawkwind]] wrote on the backside of the cover: "{{unicode|TECHNICIÄNS ÖF SPÅCE SHIP EÅRTH THIS IS YÖÜR CÄPTÅIN SPEÄKING YÖÜR ØÅPTÅIN IS DEA̋D}}". To add to the variation, [[Denmark|Danish]] letters Ø and Å are added. While the Å being a separate letter sounding like the word "Oh", the Danish Ø is actually pronounced exactly like the German and Turkish Ö. And also the diacritical mark on the last " {{unicode|A̋}} " is the "Hungarian umlaut" or [[double acute accent]] ( {{unicode|˝}} )&mdash;two short lines slanting up and to the right rather like a right double-quote mark&mdash;instead of dots (Hungarian uses neither the ( {{unicode|˝}} ) nor the traditional German umlaut ("Ä") over the letter "A", though). This was before [[Lemmy Kilmister]], later of [[Motörhead]], had become a member of the group.

[[Motörhead]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed. (American hardcore punk band [[Hüsker Dü]] debuted in January of the same year.) The umlaut in ''Motörhead'' was contributed by the graphic designer of the band's first album cover.  In the words of Lemmy, Motörhead's front man: "I only put it in there to look mean."[http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&articleid=21891] (Interestingly, the standard German pronunciation of ''Motör'' is similar to the standard English pronunciation of "motor", the umlaut over the second "o" requiring, in German, the fronting of the vowel. The French equivalent, ''moteur'', is genuinely pronounced that way.)
For the Crüe (according to [[Vince Neil]] in the band's [[Behind the Music]] edition), the inspiration came from a [[Löwenbräu]] bottle. At one [[Mötley Crüe]] performance in Germany, the entire audience started chanting "Mertley Crew-e" - a pronunciation often used in Hungary as well.
[[Image:Spinal Tap logo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|<font face="Arial Unicode MS, Arial, Helvetica, sanserif">[[This Is Spinal Tap|Spin̈al Tap]]</font> used the umlaut in an unexpected place &mdash; above a consonant.]]

[[Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the ''Y'' in their name.  (The symbol ''ÿ'' is used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] handwriting to display the [[IJ (letter)|letter IJ]] instead of IJ/ij, and, very rarely, in [[French language|French]], ''e.g.'', in the name of the Belgian-French composer [[Eugène Ysaÿe]], in the placename [[L'Haÿ-les-Roses]],[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ha%C3%BF-les-Roses] etc.)  Queensrÿche frontman [[Geoff Tate]] stated, "The umlaut over the 'y' has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it."[http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html]

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced 1980s [[space rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] used a variation on the concept, using the [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] vowel ''[[ø]]'' in their name. This may have been inspired by [[computer system]]s of the time, many of which used the [[slashed zero]] as a glyph for the digit [[0 (number)|0]] to distinguish it from the letter [[O]] and thus resembled ''ø''.  The Dutch band [[Bløf]] also uses ''ø'' in its name, even though the letter is not used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Ironically, Bløf is neither pronounced ''blof'' nor ''bløf''. Outside of rock, [[electronic music]] artist [[William Orbit]] as of recent has used the "Ø" in his surname.

The [[Parody|spoof]] band [[Spinal Tap (band)|<font face="Arial Unicode MS, Arial, Helvetica, sanserif">Spin̈al Tap</font>]] raised the stakes in 1984 by using an umlaut over the letter ''N'', a [[consonant]]. This is a construction found only in the [[Jacaltec]] language of [[Guatemala]] and in some orthographies of [[Malagasy]], although it is uncertain whether the writers of <font face="Arial Unicode MS, Arial, Helvetica, sanserif">''This Is Spin̈al Tap</font>'' knew this at the time.

== The gratuitous umlaut in other popular literature ==

The 1974 film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' included [[Madeline Kahn]]'s German-accented [[Marlene Dietrich]]-style [[chanteuse]] character "Lili Von Shtupp" (according to the credits)<!-- which is documented by IMDb-->. She is announced on a poster outside the music hall as "Lili von Shtüpp"<!-- Hmm, my "Stüpp" informant lost confidence about the consonants on seeing the credits-->; the film's characters pronounce the name without any change to the vowel.

In the mid-1980s, cartoonist [[Berkeley Breathed]] parodied the heavy metal umlaut in the comic strip [[Bloom County]] with the fictional group [[Billy and the Boingers|Deathtöngue]], fronted by the depraved and unwholesome singer/'lead tongue' [[Bill the Cat|"Wild" Bill Catt]] and infamous for the songs "Let's Run Over [[Lionel Richie]] With a Tank", "[[Clearasil]] [[Messiah]]" and "U Stink But I Love U".  Breathed eventually had Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure from congressional hearings on "porn rock" led by one "Tippy Gorp", an obvious reference to heavy metal's bane, [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]]. The Bloom County book "Billy and the Boingers Bootleg" included an acetate single with two songs from "the band", "I'm a Boinger" and "U Stink But I Love U".

In 1988, [[Jim Henson]] and [[General Foods]] released a [[breakfast cereal]], [[Cröonchy Stars]], based on the popular [[Swedish Chef]] [[muppet]].  In addition to the gratuitous umlaut in ''Cröonchy'', most of the cereal's labelling and promotional material used the idiosyncratic spelling <font face="Arial Unicode MS, Arial, Helvetica, sanserif">''Swedïsh Chef''</font>.[http://www.kermitage.com/html/collectibles/rarestuffnew/page3.html]  As with <font face="Arial Unicode MS, Arial, Helvetica, sanserif">''Spinäl Tap''</font>, this marks one of the rare instances of an umlaut being used over a consonant.

The novel ''[[Zodiac (novel)|Zodiac]]'' (1988) by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a fictional metal band called Pöyzen Böyzen, which one character describes as "not bad for a two-umlaut band".

In 1997, [[parody]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article called [http://www.theonion.com/content/node/32404 "Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts"], about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem "bad-assed and scary in a quasi-heavy metal manner".

[[Journalist]] and [[author]] Steve Almond coined the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in 2002 to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

Rock critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] subtitled his 2001 book ''Fargo Rock City'' with ''A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta''.

[[Webcomic]] artist [[Scott Kurtz]] drew a series of cartoons about a fake band called ''Djörk'' in his [[PvP Online]] webcomic. Apart from satirizing the heavy metal umlaut (the original band name was to be ''Umlaüt''), this name also refers to the Icelandic singer/songwriter [[Björk]] Guðmundsdóttir, whose umlaut is genuine.

=== Other characters ===

* The German punk band [[Die Ärzte]] used three dots over the "A" in ''Ärzte'' on their 2003 album [[Geräusch]], to distinguish from its normal spelling with "Ä" (double dot) umlaut. This can be represented in Unicode: {{unicode|Die A⃛rzte}}. The three dots may stand for the three band members. However, the "Ä" in the band name is not a heavy metal umlaut but the correct German spelling.
* A three-dot umlaut has also been seen in artwork for [[King Creosote]], over the i, as ''Ki⃛ng Cresote''.
* The American thrash band [[Lååz Rockit]] actually used the letter "[[å]]" gratuitously in their logo, but the umlaut ("Lääz Rockit") in some press releases.
* The French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]] used a [[constructed language|fictional language]], the Kobaïan, for its lyrics. The umlaut appeared in several album titles, such as ''Mekanïk Destruktïw Kommandöh'' and ''Köhntarkösz''. However, this umlaut does affect pronunciation, and thus cannot be considered gratuitous. Kobaian also uses a three-dot diacritic over some letters in song titles, and an original letter that seems to be a cursive [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of "ie", which never appears without an umlaut.
* The English [[indie rock]] band [[Maxïmo Park]] also uses a double dotted "i" in its name.
* The [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]]s and [[cedilla]] in the name of the French electronica band [[Rinôçérôse]] are also gratuitous, except the "é".
* [[William Orbit|William Ørbit]].
* The dark folk / experimental / occult band [[Death In June]] used umlauts (and in the second case, even accented e's) in the original releases of their albums ''The Wörld Thät Sümmer'' (1985) and ''Thé Wäll Öf Säcrificé'' (1989) - and, on these releases, also in the band name, leading to ''Deäth In Jüne'' and ''Déäth In Jüné'', respectively.
*the Japanese rock group [[BOØWY]]. 
* [[Perl]] developer (Terry) Brian Ingerson legally changed his name to [[Ingy döt Net]], to match his domain name.[http://blog.ingy.net/2005/11/the_ingy_formerly_known_as_bri.html]
* [[Sisqó]] (born Mark Althavan Andrews) an R&B singer and actor.
* Norwegian heavy metalband, consisting of 4 raving madmen, Idölwild uses umlauts to distance themself from both the American band Idolwild as well as showing their hate for the song competition "Idol".
* German band Metal/Oi band Störkraft

=== Non-gratuitous umlauts ===

* The umlaut in [[Die Ärzte]] is correct German orthography and not related to the heavy metal umlaut.
* The name of the [[Toronto, Ontario]] area folk-pop/geek-rock band [[Moxy Früvous]] is pronounced with long-u, "Fruuvous", so this is perhaps not gratuitous.
* The [[Florida]] [[goth]]/[[darkwave]] band [[The Crüxshadows]], is also pronounced with long-u, "Cruu-shadows", so this is also perhaps not gratuitous.
* The [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Trojan (band)|Trojan]] used umlauts in their name on the 1985 release ''Chasing the Storm''. For [[Sweden|Swedes]] the tour T-shirts from this time are particularly amusing, as "Tröjan" in Swedish translates as "the shirt".
* The [[Rhode Island]] "futurock" band [[Grüvis Malt]] have an umlaut in their name, but it may not be gratuitous, since it clarifies the pronunciation as "oo" rather than "uh".
* The [[San Francisco]] band [[Children of Umlaut]] do not in fact have an umlaut in their name.
* The Icelandic artist [[Björk]] Guðmundsdóttir is using her birth name.
* The [[Ä]] in the Finnish heavily [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]]-influenced heavy metal band [[Teräsbetoni]] ''(reinforced concrete)'' is not gratuitous; while ''teräs'' means [[steel]] in Finnish, ''teras'' is not even a word.
* The [[J-Rock|Japanese rock]] band [[Lä-ppisch]] derives its name from the German colloquialism ''läppisch'', meaning "negligible".
* The Danish [[spoof band]] [[Insidiöus Törment]] feature 2 umlauts in their name, though whether they are gratuitous or not is up for debate. The first functions as the umlaut in Motörhead, arguably indicating the use of the [[schwa]] (Ə) in pronunciation (in both names), whereas the second -— contrary to common practice —- influences the pronunciation of "torment" so that it becomes "tørment"—using the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] or [[Faroese]] vowel of [[ø]].
* The Haïti Twoubadou current in [[Haitian music]] represents a legitimate use of diacritics in a musical title, because it indicates separate pronunciation of two adjacent vowels. However, this makes it not an umlaut but a [[diaresis]]. (In [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]], ''Haïti'' is pronounced ah-ee-tee or ah-ee-tsee, with the former also being the standard [[French language|French]] pronunciation.)
* Another German band, [[Einstürzende Neubauten]] ''(collapsing new buildings)'', features an umlaut where, in German, there ought to be one.
* Two of the eight correct spellings of the [[discordian]] project [[Die Epheser]] include wrong umlauts.
* The correctly umlauted name of the German folk band [[Bläck Fööss]] means ''bare feet'' in [[Kölsch (dialect)|Kölsch]], a German dialect.

A '''heavy metal umlaut''' is an [[umlaut]] (or, more accurately [[diaeresis]]) over some of the letters in the names of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. The names of bands such as [[Motörhead]], [[Mötley Crüe]] and the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] led to [[journalist]] and [[author]] [[Steve Almond]] coining the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in [[2002]] to describe the heavy metal touring scene. Needless to say, this makes the names sound very silly to people who know how to pronounce these letters, like Scandinavians and German speakers.

The idea of this, some believe, is to give the band name a [[Nazi Germany|"Nazi" German]] look, often in concert with using [[Blackletter]] types (or more often Pseudo-Blackletter). The Nazi/[[Hitler]] theme is glorified by some heavy metal groups.

The original use appears to have been by the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] in [[1971]]. [[Motörhead]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed.

[[Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the 'y' in their name. (The "ÿ" is otherwise only used in [[French language|French]]. It is sometimes used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to display the [[Dutch Y]] instead of IJ/ij when the real &#306;/&#307; letters are unavailable.) From a linguistic viewpoint, this might be regarded as an attempt at a diaeresis, rather than as an umlaut, were it not for the fact that there are no vowels to be pronounced distinctly.

Spoof band [[Spinal Tap]] parodied the idea still further by putting the umlaut over the letter 'n'.  The n-umlaut/n-diaeresis character does not occur in any known language or belong to any standard character set, and therefore this is impossible to pronounce.  Displayed in [[Unicode]], the band name appears as "Spin&#776;al Tap;" however, as some browsers may not be able to view the proper Unicode character, here is how it appears as [[LaTeX]]: <math>Spi\ddot{n}al  \; Tap</math>. 

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced [[1980s]] [[space-rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] used a variation on the concept, using the Scandinavian vowel [[ø]] in their name.

In the mid-1980s, cartoonist Berke Breathed parodied this practice further in the [[Bloom County]] comic strip with the fictional group Deathtöngue, fronted by the depraved and unwholesome singer/'lead tongue' [[Bill the Cat|"Wild" Bill Catt]] and infamous for the songs "Let's Run Over Lionel Richie With a Tank" and "U Stink But I Love U."  In the comic strip, Breathed eventually has Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure from congressional hearings on porn rock led by one "Tippy Gorp," an obvious reference to heavy metal bête noire [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[PMRC]].

In 1997, the [[parody]] newspaper, [[The Onion]], published an article entitled "Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts", about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem tougher to the rest of the world.

Other umlaut sightings:
* the name of the band [[Assück]]
* the [[punk rock]] band [[Hüsker Dü]] 
* the term "nü-metal" used to describe [[nu metal]] with added umlaut-ness.
* gay heavy metal band/cabaret act [[Pink Stëël]] have two ''consecutive'' umlauts, the first such instance in a band name
* the [[rock en espanol|Spanish band]] [[Mägo de Oz]]

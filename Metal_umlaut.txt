A '''heavy metal umlaut''' is an [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] over a letter in the name of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. The use of umlauts and other [[diacritic]]s with a [[blackletter]] style [[typeface]] is a form of [[foreign branding]] intended to give a band's logo a [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] quality. It is a form of marketing that evokes stereotypes of boldness and strength commonly attributed to peoples such as the [[Vikings]]; author Reebee Garofalo has attributed its use to a desire for a "[[Gothic horror]]" feel.<ref>Garofalo, pg. 292 <small>''Some groups, for example Blue Öyster Cult and Motörhead, added gratuitous umlauts to their names to conjure up a more generic gothic horror, a practice that continued into the 1980s with Mötley Crüe and others.''</ref> The heavy metal umlaut is never referred to by the term ''[[diaeresis]]'' in this usage, nor is it intended to affect the pronunciation of the band's name.

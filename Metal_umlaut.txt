A '''heavy metal umlaut''' is an [[umlaut]] over letters in the name of a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. Umlauts and other [[diacritic]]s with a [[blackletter]] style [[typeface]] are a form of [[foreign branding]] intended to give a band's logo a tough Germanic feel. They are also called '''röckdöts'''.  The heavy metal umlaut is never referred to by the term ''[[diaeresis]]'' in this usage, nor does it affect the pronunciation of the band's name.  

In [[2002]]<!-- we're still not sure what exact issue - FIXME -->, ''[[Spin magazine]]'' referred to the heavy metal umlaut as "the diacritical mark of the beast." 

Heavy metal umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction. David St. Hubbins ([[Michael McKean]]) in the film ''[[Spinal Tap|This Is Spinal Tap]]'' opined, "It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you."

==History==
The [[progressive rock]] band [[Amon Düül]] released their first album in [[1969]]. However, their name came from "[[Ammon|Amon]] being an Egyptian sun god, [[Düül]] a character from Turkish fiction" [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=UIDMISS70406050306300345&sql=B1c8j1vsjzzza], so this use of diaereses was not gratuitous.

The first ''gratuitous'' use appears to have been by the [[Blue Öyster Cult]] in [[1970]]. The band's website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist [[Allen Lanier]] [http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history3.html], but rock critic [[Richard Meltzer]] claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager [[Sandy Pearlman]] just after Pearlman came up with the name: "I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect anyway." [http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html]

[[Hawkwind]] on their second album ''[[In Search of Space]]'' (1971) wrote on the backside of the cover: "TECHNICIÄNS ÖF SPÅCE SHIP EÅRTH THIS IS YÖÜR CÄPTÅIN SPEÄKING YÖÜR ØÅPTÅIN IS DEÄD". To add to the variation, the last "Ä" has short lines instead of dots. This was before Lemmy, later of Motörhead, had become a member of the group.

[[Mot&ouml;rhead]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] then followed. The umlaut in ''Mot&ouml;rhead'' was in fact a creation of the graphic designer responsible for the first album cover, because "it looks mean." The usage stuck.

[[Image:Spinal Tap logo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Spinal Tap]] used the umlaut in an unexpected place &mdash; above a consonant.]]

[[Queensrÿche]] went further by putting the umlaut over the ''Y'' in their name.  (It is sometimes used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] handwriting to display the [[Dutch Y]] instead of IJ/ij, and very rarely used in [[French language|French]].) From a linguistic viewpoint, this might be regarded as an attempt at a diaeresis, rather than as an umlaut, were it not that there are no vowels to be pronounced distinctly.

[[Hawkwind]]-influenced [[1980s]] [[space-rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] used a variation on the concept, using the Scandinavian vowel ''[[ø]]'' in their name.

The [[spoof]] band [[Spinal Tap]] raised the stakes in [[1982]] by using an umlaut over the letter ''N'', a [[consonant]]. This is a construction only found in the [[Jacaltec]] language of [[Guatemala]], although it is questionable whether the writers of ''This Is Spinal Tap'' knew this at the time.

==Languages that use umlauts or diaereses==

Ironically for speakers of languages which rely on umlauts, such as [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the umlauted vowels represent a weaker, lighter sound rather than the intended impression of strength and darkness.  

At one Mötley Crüe  performance in Germany, the entire audience started chanting, "Moertley Creuh!" Queensr&yuml;che frontman [[Geoff Tate]] stated, "The umlaut over the 'y' has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it."

The German word ''Umlaut'' comes from "''um-'', meaning "to change" and ''Laut'', meaning "sound"; the ''U'' and ''Ü'' and ''O'' and ''Ö'' are pronounced differently.   The English word ''diaeresis'' comes from a Greek word meaning "divide or distinguish".  It is usually used to indicate that two [[vowel]]s are to be pronounced separately, as in the name ''Chloë'', or the word ''coöperation''.

==The heavy metal umlaut in popular literature==

In the mid-1980s, cartoonist Berke Breathed parodied the heavy metal umlaut in the comic strip [[Bloom County]] with the fictional group [[Deathtöngue]], fronted by the depraved and unwholesome singer/'lead tongue' [[Bill the Cat|"Wild" Bill Catt]] and infamous for the songs "Let's Run Over Lionel Richie With a Tank" and "U Stink But I Love U".  Breathed eventually had Deathtöngue change their name to the umlaut-free [[Billy and the Boingers]] following pressure from congressional hearings on "porn rock" led by one "Tippy Gorp", an obvious reference to heavy metal [[bête noire]] [[Tipper Gore]] and the [[PMRC]].

The novel ''[[Zodiac (book)|Zodiac]]'' (1988) by [[Neal Stephenson]] features a fictional band called P&ouml;yzen B&ouml;yzen, whom another character describes as "not bad for a two-umlaut band."

In 1997, [[parody]] newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'' published an article called "Ünited Stätes Toughens Image With Umlauts", about a [[United States Congress|congressional]] attempt to add umlauts to the name of the [[United States|United States of America]] to make it seem "bad-assed and scary in a quasi-heavy-metal manner."

[[Journalist]] and [[author]] [[Steve Almond]] coined the term "[[spandex]] and umlaut circuit" in [[2002]] to describe the heavy metal touring scene.

Rock critic [[Chuck Klosterman]] subtitled his [[2003]] book ''Fargo Rock City'' with ''A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural Nörth Daköta''.

==Other musical usages of diacritics in band naming==

* the novelty rock band [[Green Jellÿ]] added an umlaut when changing their name from "Green Jello"
* the [[Music of England|English]] [[NWOBHM]] band [[Holocaust_(band)|Holocaust]] spelled their name Hölöcäust on their first [[7"]], "Heavy Metal Mania."
* the [[Music of Canada|Canadian]] [[thrash metal]] band [[Infernäl Mäjesty]].
* the [[Music of France|French]] [[black metal]] band [[Mütiilation]].
* the [[Florida]] [[grindcore]] band [[Assück]].
* my young sister hard-folk combo [[Pënêtràsïön]].
* the [[crust (music)|crust]] band [[Leftover Crack|Leftöver Crack]]
* the [[Florida]] [[goth]]/[[darkwave]] band [[The Crüxshadows]].
* the [[Music of Australia|Australia]]n [[thrash metal|black/thrash metal]] band [[Deströyer 666]]
* the German punk band [[Die Ärzte]] used three dots (triaeresis?) over the "A" in ''Ärzte'' to distinguish from its normal spelling with a (double dot) diaeresis. This can be represented in Unicode: Die A&#8411;rzte.
* [[D&uuml;rty Nelly's Pub]], a rock bar in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].
* the [[punk rock]] band [[Hüsker Dü]]. The name is a [[Danish language|Danish]] phrase meaning "Do you remember?". However, ü is not used in Danish and the correct phrase would be "husker du?" The band took their name from a [[Husker Du? (game)|children's memory game]], which added [[macron]]s over each u in the phrase, replacing these macrons with umlauts.
* the American thrash band [[Lååz Rockit]] actually used the letter "[[Å|å]]" gratuitously in their logo, but the umlaut ("Lääz Rockit") in some press releases.
* the French band [[Magma (band)|Magma]] used a fictional language, the Kobaïan, for its lyrics. The umlaut appeared in several album titles, such as ''Mekanïk Destruktïw Kommandöh'' and ''Köhntarkösz''. However, this umlaut does affect pronunciation, and thus cannot be considered gratuitous. Kobaian also uses a three-dot diacritic over some letters in song titles, and an original letter that seems to be a cursive [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of "ie", which never appears without an umlaut.
* the [[Toronto, Ontario]] area folk-pop/geek-rock band [[Moxy Früvous]]
* [[Peoria, Illinois]] band [[Mudvayne]] listed their members on one release as Chüd, Güüg, R-üD and Spüg.
* the [[rock en espanol|Spanish band]] [[Mägo de Oz]].
* the term "nü-metal," used to describe [[nu metal]] with added umlautness.
* gay heavy metal band/cabaret act [[Pink Stëël]] have two ''consecutive'' gratuitous umlauts, the first such instance in a band name. The library/scifi metal band [[Bl&ouml;&ouml;dhag]] also have consecutive gratuitous umlauts.
* the [[Devin Townsend]] punk parody project [[Punky Brüster]].
* the accents in the name of the French electronica band [[Rinôçérôse]] are also gratuitous.
* the Canadian thrash band [[Voivod (band)|Voïvod]]'s second album from 1986 was titled ''RRRÖÖÖAAARRR''. This album title actually has three consecutive gratuitous umlauts. The band's name has an umlaut over the I, but this may be acting as a diæresis.
* [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Trojan (band)|Trojan]] used umlauts in their name on the 1985 release ''Chasing the Storm''. For [[Sweden|Swedes]] the tour T-shirts from this time are particularly amusing, as "Tröjan" in Swedish translates as "the shirt".
* the Finnish hardcore punk band [[Ümlaut]].
* [[Zee (band)|Zee]], a short-lived band formed by [[Pink Floyd]] keyboard player [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] and [[Dave Harris]], made excessive use of gratuitous umlauts on their 1984 album ''[[Identity (album)|Identity]]'' which included song titles such as "Cönfüsiön" and "Höw Dö Yöü Dö It".
* Rhode Island "futurock" band Grüvis Malt has an umlaut in their name, but it may not be gratuitous, since it clarifies the pronunciation as "oo" rather than "uh."
*[[William Orbit|William Ørbit]].
The [[San Francisco]] band [[Children of Umlaut]] do not in fact have an umlaut in their name.
